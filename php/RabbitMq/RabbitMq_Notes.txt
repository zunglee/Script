RabbitMQ :
1.)  RabbitMQ is a message broker: it accepts and forwards messages.
2.)  A queue is only bound by the host's memory & disk limits
3.) Many producers can send messages that go to one queue, and many consumers can try to receive data from one queue.
4.) Consuming has a similar meaning to receiving. A consumer is a program that mostly waits to receive messages
    ** producer, consumer, and broker do not have to reside on the same host; indeed in most applications they don't
